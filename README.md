In this project, I developed a tool to support communication for children with autism by utilizing deep learning for sound classification. The tool uses 'Teachable Machine' to create a sound model that classifies spoken words heard by the child through headphones. A Raspberry Pi 4, functioning as a compact computer, is used to embed the trained sound model and serves as the main processing unit.
